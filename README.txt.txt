This code was written to be used alongside a grip sensor, specifically for a sequence task. A fuller description will be provided in the future.

Running instructions:
-Open Matlab
-Open the script called: Grip_task_track_main.m

This script contains the functions required for the sequence task. It is ready to run "as is", but you may change many of the parameters 
in the setup_parameters.m script. Make sure the main script, alonsgide all its functions, are located in the same folder.
